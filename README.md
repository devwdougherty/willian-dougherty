* # Professional Overview
  Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Sorocaba, awarded with an integral scholarship in the PROUNI program. I     started in the computer field becoming a computer technician by CPS (Centro Paula Souza). In addition to a graduate computer scientist,   I'm happy to say I also focus on entrepreneurship and acting as an investor and financial market consultant.

  With the passage of time I tried to acquire new knowledge and experiences, this led me to start studies in the field of financial         investments for generation and accumulation of income. I am currently an investor in the Stock Exchange and also in several fixed income   securities. This is in addition to my constant interest in the search for learning within the entrepreneurship applied to startups and     also the generation of ideas.

  In addition to the computing and corporate area that I work professionally, I look for new challenges that cover several aspects, be       they technology, economics or innovation for problem-solving.
