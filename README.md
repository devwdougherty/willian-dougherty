## Professional Overview
  Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Sorocaba (2017), contemplated with integral scholarship in the PROUNI program. I started in the area of ​​technology becoming a computer technician by CPS (Centro Paula Souza) in 2013.

  Even though I have the main career in the area of ​​software development, I like to practice other skills that are dear to any good professional. In 2017, I started a personal project called Zurique Consultoria, where I provide personalized service to people who wish to organize their own and make investments with a focus on financial independence. Such services are based on my own experiences as a financial market investor.

  I like challenges and opportunities for innovation with a focus on generating and executing ideas. In 2018, when I saw an opportunity to learn and apply concepts, I started as a volunteer strategic consultant for the Ello Contabilidade office located in Sorocaba / SP. I'm also constantly looking for and applying on independent projects and business ideas.

  As a programmer, I'm always on the lookout for continuous learning driven execution on today's technology fronts. At present, I'm working on R&D projects and Product/Services development projects within the area of ​​Web/Mobile Software Development. Some concepts of projects already experienced in my career: Facial Recognition by Algorithm, Natural Language, Circular Economy with intelligent management, data control on component production, Enterprise Resource Planning (system development and support).
